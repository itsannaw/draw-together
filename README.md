# Draw Together

The application is a "collaborative drawing boadr" for everyone. 

• No registration or authentication, all users have immediate access to the "boards" list (the user only provides arbitrary nick-name).

• Each user can create board or join existing boards.

• Several users can draw on the same board simultaneously. When somebody draw something, it appears to other users "immediately".

• Everything drawn on the board is stored "forever" (if user joins this board later, he/she sees everything what was created before).

• Drawing area fill the whole window (except, probably, the tool panel) and scale/scroll adequately.

• Ability to erase previously draw elements.

• Several tools ("text", "rectangle", "circle", etc.) with colors.

• Export to jpeg option.
